# Applinces-Energy-Prediction-ML-Regression
**Abstract:** As the energy crisis increasing day by day causes various factors to think for in todays scenario. It not only affecting the world energy requirement issues but also affects the economic and social health of any country, mostly in the countries which are going through developing phase. To overcome several related issues, it is necessary to have the outages in order to compensate the load demand. And hence the prediction of energy used by appliances plays a vital role in the study. This article illustrates the energy consumed by house and the data has been collected with the help of sensors. The readings have been taken for each 10 min interval for consecutive 4.5 months. Saving of energy can be done by controlling the energy usage. And thus, prediction of usage comes into picture. This study can save the money of consumer as well as if extra energy is generated then it can also fed back to Grid(Also called as regeneration). The article mainly concentrates over the study with the help of machine learning regression technique to find out the energy consumption prediction.
